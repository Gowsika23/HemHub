# HemHub ü©∏ Blood-Bank-Management-System

This web-based application serves as an intermediate platform between **Hospitals/Clinics** and **Donors/Receivers** for effective blood donation and management. It helps hospitals maintain blood inventory and manage donation requests efficiently. I have developed as part of a full-stack PHP-MySQL-based project for connecting blood donors with hospitals efficiently.
